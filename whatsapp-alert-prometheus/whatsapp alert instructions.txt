prometheus values has been updated so that both email and webhook-notifications are fired when alert goes off

webhook-server receives the JSON file sent by alert manager, which is then processed. Then a request is sent to waha server, which sends the message to the specified whatsapp number.

webhook-server-deployment.yaml file is in alertmanager-webhook folders which has to be applied. It uses an unoptimizedly created nodejs app, which needs to be optimized.

waha-deployment is in the main folder. It currently uses the images created by devillikeapro repo, the image needs to be created and modified for self hosting purposes.

Okay, now, Waha server might crash, in which case, the session needs to be restarted. (this process has to be automated somehow so that session starts when the server starts by default)

prometheus can be modified to receive different levels of alerts for different levels of security, this has to be refined further. email and whatsapp messages should only be reserved for severe cases.

Most likely, calls are possible. Not sure yet. Discord and Teams integration seems feasible.
